The tests are organized as follows

debug:
contains scripts useful during the development testing of the framework,
stored here for future reuse

manual:
test cases where the output has to be manuallt verified, e.g. compared with
other published results or by visual sanity checking

unittest:
Unit tests, these should be quick and fully automatic and are therefore 
generally tests deterministic subparts of the framework.
