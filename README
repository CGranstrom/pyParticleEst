This is a library to assist with calculations for estimation problems using 
particle based methods, it contains a number of algorithms such as the 
Particle Filter, Auxiliary Particle Filter and support several variants of
Particle Smoothing through the use of Backwars Simulation techniques but
also methods such as Metropolis-Hastings Backward Proposer and Metropolis-
Hastings Improved Particle Smoother.

It also provides a framework for doing parameter estimation in nonlinear
models using Expectation Maximization combined with the particle smoothing
algorithms presented above.

The structure is based on presenting a number of interfaces that a problem
specific class must implement in order to use the algorithms. To assisst the
end user base classes for common model structures, such as 
Mixed Linear/Nonlinear Gaussian models are provided to keep the implementation
effor to a minimum.

The idea is to provide an easy prototyping enviroment for testing different
algorithms and models formulations when solving a problem and act as a stepping
stone for a later more performance oriented problem specific implementation by
the end user.

At the moment the main source of documentation are the examples/testcases which
are found under the test/ directory

Structure:
models/ - This subdirectory contains helper classes for common models, e.g Mixed Linear/Non-linear Gaussian models.
test/ - This subdirectory contains test cases/examples
