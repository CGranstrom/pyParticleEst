This is a library to assist with calculations for estimation problems using particle based methods, 
especially Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter and Smoothing.

It is currently under development being broken out from an existing application.

Currently there is no documentation other than the fairly well commented "test/simple_test.py" example.

Structure:
models/ - This subdirectory contains helper classes for common models, e.g Mixed Linear/Non-linear Gaussian models.

test/ - This subdirectory contains test cases/examples
