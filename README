This is a library to assist with calculations for estimation problems using 
particle based methods, it contains a number of algorithms such as the 
Particle Filter, Auxiliary Particle Filter and support several variants of
Particle Smoothing through the use of Backward Simulation (FFBSi) techniques but
also methods such as the Metropolis-Hastings Backward Proposer (MHBP) and the Metropolis-
Hastings Improved Particle Smoother (MHIPS).

It also provides a framework for doing parameter estimation in nonlinear
models using Expectation Maximization combined with the particle smoothing
algorithms presented above. (PS-EM).

The use of Rao-Blackwellized models is considered an importan special case
and extensive support for it is provided.

The structure is based on presenting a number of interfaces that a problem
specific class must implement in order to use the algorithms. To assisst the
end user base classes for common model structures, such as 
Mixed Linear/Nonlinear Gaussian (MLNLG) models are provided to keep the 
implementation effort to a minimum.

The idea is to provide an easy prototyping enviroment for testing different
algorithms and model formulations when solving a problem and to act as a 
stepping stone for a later more performance oriented problem specific 
implementation by the end user. (outside the scope of this framework)

At the moment the main source of documentation are the examples and testcases
which are found under the test/ directory
